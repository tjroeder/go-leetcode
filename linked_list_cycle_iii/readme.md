# Description
Given the `head` of a **linked list**, determine the length of the cycle present in the **linked list**. If there is no cycle, return `0`.

A cycle exists in a **linked list** if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `Next` pointer.

Constraints:
-The number of nodes in the list is in the range <code>[0,10<sup>4</sup>]</code>.
- <code>−10<sup>5</sup>≤−10<sup>5</sup>≤ Node.Value ≤10<sup>5</sup>≤10<sup>5</sup></code>
