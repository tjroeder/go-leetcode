# 57. Insert Interval

# Difficulty

# Description
You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals `intervals` where <code>intervals[i] = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>]</code> represent the start and the end of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> interval and `intervals` is sorted in ascending order by <code>start<sub>i</sub></code>. You are also given an interval `newInterval = [start, end]` that represents the start and end of another interval.

Insert `newInterval` into `intervals` such that `intervals` is still sorted in ascending order by <code>start<sub>i</sub></code> and `intervals` still does not have any overlapping intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).

Return `intervals` after the insertion.

Note that you don't need to modify `intervals` in-place. You can make a new array and return it.

Example 1:
```
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]
Output: [[1,5],[6,9]]
```

Example 2:
```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]
Output: [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]
Explanation: Because the new interval [4,8] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].
```

Constraints:
- <code>0 <= intervals.length <= 10<sup>4</sup></code>
- <code>intervals[i].length == 2</code>
- <code>0 <= start<sub>i</sub> <= end<sub>i</sub> <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
- `intervals` is sorted by <code>start<sub>i</sub></code> in **ascending order**.
- <code>newInterval.length == 2</code>
- <code>0 <= start <= end <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
